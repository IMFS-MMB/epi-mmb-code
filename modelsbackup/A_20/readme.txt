Folders:
-basecasesimulations.m : a base-case simulation with various constant values of R_t (tranmission rate) that give you figure 2,3,4 in the working paper.
-mitigationspeed.m : This m file conducts a simulations of mitigation speed maintained forever with various values of eta (mitigation speed) that give you figure 5,6,7 in the working paper
-temporarysuppression.m: This m file implements a simulation with a temporary intense suppression of transmission of the virus that give you figure 8 in the working paper
