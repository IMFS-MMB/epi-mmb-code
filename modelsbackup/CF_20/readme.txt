Several replication files for 'Stay-at-Home Orders in a Fiscal Union' are included in this folder:


SIRCompStats.r simulates the model with three locations and performs a comparative statics exercise with the initial population, initial infection rates, and transmission across locations. (Figure A.8) (~30 seconds)
SIRMultipleLocations.R simulates the model with one location and compares the results with a 21-location simulation. (Figure 9) (~10 minutes)
SIRPolicy.R simulates the model with two locations and compares the results of the optimal policy decision with and without the restriction that the same consumption tax must be used across locations. (Figures 11 and A.9) (~2 hours)
