1) Open main.m
2) Choose value of "do" for your purpose (do=2 or do=14 for figure in the paper):
	do==1 % to calibrate b fitting Swedish data (15.7% increase in d+v in week 9)
	do==2 % selected policies (tables, figures) for 4 calibration strategies (with/without teleworking, high/low b)
	do==3 % some numbers for the "no disease" column in the benchmark results table
	do==4 % planner solution
	do==5 % simulates some optimal lockdowns (4 weeks)
	do==6 % vaccine takes a long time to arrive
	do==7 % non-targeted moments
	do==8 % no altruism
	do==9 % Ferguson
	do==10 % policies with hospital constraints
	do==11 % no natural deaths for the old
	do==12 % partial equilibrium analysis w.r.t. optimal policy
	do==13 % late lockdown
	do==14 % simulates some optimal lockdowns (1 week)
	do==15 % optimal policy (4 week) without teleworking
	do==16 % figures_optimal (tw1_bH)
	do==17 % figures_optimal (tw0_bH)
	do==18 % table: optimal policy with testing and quarantine
	do==19 % figure: optimal policy with testing and quarantine
	do==20 % computes CEV of some lockdowns compared to epidemiological
	do==21 % social interactions by old in ND and at peak
